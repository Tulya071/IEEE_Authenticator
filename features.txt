features:

1. No author can provide more than one paper.
2. The credentials are confidential to particular authors only.
3. The project's server is running on multiple ports removing the dependency on each other at the time of a server crash.
4. The reviewer can add comments to the particular documents already reviewed and the author will be notified through the registered mail and resubmit his/her paper again.
5. The admin and reviewer have tables and flowcharts on their dashboards which would be providing them with pictorial representation of the papers and their status.
6. Respective reviewers have their respective mails to for login and cant have access to papers other than their streams.(to be implemented)

Future scopes:

>> We can implement web socket to show the real time status of the submitted paper to the author.
>> We can add MFA for all the three roles for extra security.
